Project Name: COMIX-STRIP: "Jannah goes to Jannah (heaven)"

Project Description: what is the project, what is the overall concept and theme, and what kind of experience you were striving to create:
The goal was to create a story that included mystery, "detective work" and a plot that would keep the reader hooked until the end (hence the murder investigation).
Moreover, through our website, we wanted the reader to feel like they were investigators in a case, hence the interactivity when it came to choosing which character the reader wanted to "hear from".
With this project, we also wanted to implement the skills we learned during class, such as working with html, css, js, photoshop, illustrator, jquery, flexbox... . We also included notions learnt in Scott McCloud's "Understanding Comics".

Process: How did you go about implementing the concept?
In order for our project to come to life, there were many different phases of work:
1- Brainstorming/Wireframing : We first had a brainstorming session that ended with us creating the outline and sketches for our story. Then, we put together a wireframe to help us better imagine what the website is gonna look like, and also how many panels/ pictures we were going to include.
2-Photo session: Then, we went to different places on campus to take the pictures we needed for the comic. The wireframing came in handy because it helped us check if we had taken all the necessary photos or not.
3- Photo editing: Next, with the help of Photoshop, Illustrator, and a few external apps, we edited all the panels of the story, creating some visual effects on some of them (such as reactions, and filters...), we also added dialogue boxes to some of our panels so the reader would fully understand the story.
4- Website Creation: With the help of a text editor, we created the website, including all the different web pages and links between them. We would say that this is where our vision truly came to reality, but this is also where some of the elements in the wireframe didn't make the cut, for either simplicity reasons, or just trying to make the website more user-friendly and the story easier to follow up with.
Reflection/Evaluation: This should bookend the initial concept and talk about whether your expectations and goals were met in the process of building the final working version.
We are very satisfied with the result of our work. We feel like our vision truly came to life with the personal contribution of every member of the team, whether it was editing, coding, writing, taking pictures... . There will always be room for improvement, but we still feel very satisfied with the final product.
